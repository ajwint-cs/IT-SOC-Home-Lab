## Lab Journal

This directory contains my personal lab notes, observations, and learning experiences while building and working with the IT-SOC Home Lab. Unlike the formal documentation in the main repository, these notes are slightly informal and represent my hands-on journey.

## Purpose

The lab journal serves several purposes:

- Document real-world implementation details not covered in formal documentation
- Track challenges encountered and solutions discovered
- Record evolving learning insights and "aha" moments
- Provide practical context for theoretical concepts
- Maintain a historical record of the lab's development

## Structure

The journal is organized as follows:

daily-activities/ - Chronological record of lab implementation tasks

- Network configuration experiences
- Active Directory management
- Security tools deployment
- Help desk implementation

troubleshooting/ - Problems encountered and their solutions

- Common issues faced during setup
- Debugging techniques that worked
- Workarounds and fixes

## Note Format

These notes are deliberately more informal than the main documentation and include:

- Command snippets I found useful
- Screenshots of interesting configurations
- Personal observations on what worked/didn't work
- Questions that arose during implementation
- Links to helpful external resources I discovered

## Using This Journal

Feel free to explore these notes for practical examples of implementing the concepts described in the main documentation. The journal entries often include additional context and practical tips not found in formal documentation.

For official, vetted documentation, please refer to the main documentation directories.

## Contributing

As I continue working with the lab, I'll update these journal entries with new experiences and insights. This is a living document that grows with the lab itself.
