# Incident Response Procedures

This document outlines the incident response procedures, simulations, and documentation practices implemented in the lab environment.

## Attack Simulation Scenarios

The lab environment supports end-to-end incident response exercises:

### Phishing Campaign Simulation

1. Deploy simulated phishing email to lab users
2. Execute macro-enabled document on SOC workstation
3. Monitor initial compromise and lateral movement
4. Practice containment and eradication procedures

### Lateral Movement Exercise

1. Simulate compromised workstation using Atomic Red Team: (SOC-WS01)--> Invoke-AtomicTest T1021.001 -TestNumbers 1
2. Track credential theft attempts
3. Monitor for suspicious connections to Domain Controller
4. Implement containment strategies using firewall rules

### Data Exfiltration Detection

1. Simulate sensitive data gathering
2. Attempt exfiltration through various channels
3. Practice detection using network monitoring
4. Implement blocking mechanisms

## Response Procedure Validation

### SOAR Integration Testing

1. Validate playbook execution for different alert types
2. Test automated containment actions
3. Verify notification workflows
4. Document mean time to detection and response

### Recovery Procedures

1. Implement system restore from snapshots
2. Validate data recovery processes
3. Verify service restoration procedures
4. Document lessons learned from simulations

## Incident Response Practice

### Generate Simulated Incidents

1. Generate simulated incidents using Atomic Red Team tests
2. Execute coordinated response across security tools
3. Document timeline of events, affected systems, and remediation steps
4. Practice stakeholder communications and technical reporting

### Alert Triage Process

1. Investigate high-priority Suricata alerts using Hunt interface
2. Categorize alerts by MITRE ATT&CK tactics and techniques
3. Perform initial investigation using Sysmon correlation: `_id:"<alert_id>" AND winlog.event_id:1`
4. Evaluate whether alerts represent true positive or false positive situations

## Documentation and Reporting Practice

### Standardized Reporting Templates

The lab facilitates development of communication skills through structured templates:

#### Incident Reports

- Executive summary for leadership
- Technical details for IT/security teams
- Timeline of events and response actions
- Recommendations for future prevention

#### Threat Intelligence Briefs

- Adversary TTPs observed in lab exercises
- Indicators of compromise (IOCs)
- Detection recommendations
- Mitigation strategies

#### Security Posture Assessments

- Environment security baseline status
- Vulnerability management metrics
- Security control effectiveness
- Remediation priorities and roadmap

### Documentation Practice Workflow

1. Create detailed analysis notes during investigations
2. Translate technical findings into business impact
3. Develop concise executive summaries
4. Practice presenting findings to simulated stakeholders

## Post-Incident Activities

- Document metrics including time to detection, containment, and recovery
- Conduct root cause analysis
- Update detection rules and response playbooks based on findings
- Share lessons learned with team members
- Implement preventive measures to avoid similar incidents
