# IT-SOC Home Lab

A comprehensive Security Operations Center (SOC) and IT administration home lab environment designed to simulate enterprise-level security monitoring, incident response, and system administration capabilities.

## Overview

This project documents the design, implementation, and operation of a sophisticated IT and security operations home lab. The lab simulates an enterprise environment with multiple network segments, security monitoring tools, and IT infrastructure services.

## Key Features

- Multi-segmented network architecture with pfSense firewall implementing defense-in-depth
- Windows Server 2022 Active Directory domain with Group Policy implementation
- Security Onion 2 deployment with Suricata, Zeek, Wazuh, and Elastic Stack
- Isolated malware analysis environment with REMnux and FlareVM
- IT service infrastructure including print services, file sharing, and Windows update management
- Comprehensive documentation of infrastructure, configurations, and operational procedures

## Lab Architecture

[Include your network diagram here]

The lab consists of the following key components:

- Segmented network with DMZ, user, and server VLANs
- pfSense firewall providing network security and segmentation
- Windows Server 2022 domain controller
- Security Onion 2 for security monitoring and threat detection
- Malware analysis workstations in isolated environment
- Client machines for testing and user simulation

## Documentation Structure
